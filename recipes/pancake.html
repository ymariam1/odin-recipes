<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  If these pancakes were any lighter, they would float off the plate--and I
  didn't even separate the eggs and whip the whites. Also, I used water instead
  of milk--and I liked them better that way. I like to serve these with a pat of
  butter, a pinch of lemon zest, and a drizzle of maple syrup.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>¾ cup cold water or milk</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
  <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (just the yellow part of the skin)</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
  <li>1 large egg</li>
  <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
  <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons self-rising flour</li>
</ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese,
    lemon zest, vegetables oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth,
    breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix. Add melted butter, lemon juice, and
    1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour. Whisk together, stirring until
    most of flour disappears into the batter.
  </li>
  <li>Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>
    Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.
    Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches). When
    bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes start to
    look dry (2 to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until cooked through, 2
    to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.
